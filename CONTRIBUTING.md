## How to contribute to Spellviewer

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/IUS-CS/3MasterGames/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

<!--- * For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines](). -->

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Spellviewer will generally not be accepted (read more about [our rationales behind this decision](https://github.com/IUS-CS/3MasterGames/edit/Cliftonz-patch-3/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [issues under feature request](https://github.com/IUS-CS/3MasterGames/issues).

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question to zac16530@gmail.com.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Rails documentation?**

* Please contact zac16530@gmail.com.

* We use visual Studio with sonarlint to create our code. We expect everyone to use Pascel case and to tag all public methods of a class with at least summary, parameater, and return.

Example

        <summary>  
          This class performs an important function.  
        </summary>
        <param name="name">
          description of what the pramaters are doing.
        </param>   
        <returns> 
          description of what is being returned.
        </returns>  
        public void method(){}

Thanks!
