## Spellviewer For DND 5E

Have you got tired of flipping through your PHB looking for your spells? Do you keep finding yourself putting your fingers inbetween your pages just so you can make a choice? Well, with Spellviewer you will have all of the spells at your finger tips. This application lists out all current spells, allows you to filter by class, spell level and specfic parts of the spell like if it is a ritual spell or a concentration spell, and display all component of a a spell. We have a few expansions planned that you can read about in the Future Expansion part down below and you can look at the different phases we plan to go through in the projects tab.

### Backstory

This application is a reboot of an old program that was infected with malware. It was a great program thus we want to recreate it, but unfortunately it has been wiped from the internet, except one copy. That last copy lives its days in a virtual container so that it doen't to harm another piece of software. We are using it to model a new redesign of  the orginal Spellviewer.

### Issues

   If you find a bug or you want to see something implemented, place an issue in and the team will do the best we can to accomadte your request. 
   
### Building

After you download the folder, you will need to make sure visual studio is installe and then click on the .sln file. Afterwhich, you will need to build the program or press start in visual studio.

### Future Expansions 

In addition, to the base part of this program we would like to also add these following expansions in the future -

1) add a Spellbook that:

   a. Allows the user can choose spell to be listed.
   
   b. Keep track of there spell slots ( how many uses of a spell per level left).

2) add an editor that:
    
   a. Allows the user to add there own classes and subclasses and modifiy esisting clasess.
   
   b. Allows the user to add there own spells and modify existing spells.
